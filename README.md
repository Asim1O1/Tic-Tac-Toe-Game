**Tic Tac Toe Game**

**Overview**
This project showcases my skills in developing a command-line interface (CLI) based Tic Tac Toe game using Java. The game offers two modes: human vs. human and human vs. computer, providing an engaging and interactive experience. This mini-project allowed me to apply various programming concepts and data structures effectively.

**Features**
Two Game Modes:
Human vs. Human
Human vs. Computer
User Input Handling: Ensures valid moves and updates the game board accordingly.
Game Logic: Implements the core game mechanics, including:
Looping constructs
Conditional statements
Object-oriented principles (classes, objects, and inheritance)
